A. Core Feature Validation
1)	list each (working) feature & comment on what is/is not working (4x5=20%)
2)	unified input working? (10%)
3)	scrapped content combined uniformly? (10%)
4)	user friendly interface? (10%)
5)	strategies to avoid duplicate entries? (10%)

B. Selenium Testing
-Record a test suite on one complete workflow, name it test_sec1_group3.html

C. Behavior Modeling
-adequate sequence diagram? (10%)

D. Report
1)	Screenshots illustrate website use? (10%)
2)	For each feature in A.1), could the feature be recoded with the given documentation? (10%)


A.
1)(13/20)
3/4		Unified Search Form- Can manually type incorrect dates (cannot do at homeaway).  Can type nonsense location.
3/4		Unified Output- Price broken for homeaway, airbnb results always on top.
4/4		Suggested Location- Works fine.
1/4		Local Restaurants- No information about restaurant, not sorted.
2/4		Comparator- Not enough room, display less information than iframe.
0/4		Google Map- Works first time, never works again until new search.
2)(?/10)	can manually type incorrect dates or nonsense location.
3)(?/10)	airbnb is always on top of homeaway, homeaway prices are wrong.
4)(4/10)	lose ability to look at map while comparing sites, no room to compare sites.
5)(5/10)	Location more accurate duplicate check than name (name ex: safe appt in cupertino).

B. 

C.(5/10)	Not enough returns for sequence to be maintained, not a true sequence since things seem to happen concurrently.

D. 
1)(10/10)	Yes, well documented.
2)(5/10)	Unified Search Form- documentation says error checking for incorrect date, but the user can type incorrect dates or a nonsense location manually without error.  More detail would ease recoding.
		Unified Output- More detail would ease recoding.
		Suggested Location- More detail would ease recoding.
		Local Restaurants- More detail would ease recoding.
		Comparator- Detailed explanation of implementation, could be recoded.
		Google Map- More detail would ease recoding.


Additional Notes:

Under sites used, not mentioned that the following two are used:
date comparison taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/492994/compare-dates-with-javascript
date picker taken from http://jqueryui.com/

Using http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/, determined that homepage weighs in at ~1MB due to extensive javascript for date picker.  Alternative, much lighter weight date picker can be seen at https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js

See incorrect_price1/2 for homeaway price errors, and website_size for ~1MB size estimate.
